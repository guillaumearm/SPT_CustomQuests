const myExampleQuest = {
  id: "trap_quest_example_1_with_api",
  trader_id: "mechanic",
  name: "My first quest",
  description: "My first quest description",
  success_message: "My success message",
};

// call this in `delayedLoad` method
const injectQuests = (logger: ILogger) => {
  if (!globalThis.CustomQuestsAPI) {
    logger.error(`CustomQuestsAPI not found, are you sure a version of CustomQuests >= 2.2.0 is installed ?`);
    return;
  }

  globalThis.CustomQuestsAPI.load([myExampleQuest]);
}
```

#### Typescript support
