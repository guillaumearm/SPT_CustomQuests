## A minimal example
```json
{
  "id": "#trap_quest_example_1#",
  "trader_id": "mechanic"
}
```

- `id`: is mandatory and should be unique, it allows you to identity your quest.
- `trader_id`: could be a regular id (like `579dc571d53a0658a154fbec`) or an alias (please see the list just below).

âš  It's very recommended to surround your id with `#`, this is to prevent a weird BSG bug on the client (at some point, the client does not strict match the ids but trying to search if the string is contained into another)

#### Available trader aliases
- `prapor`
- `therapist`
- `fence`
- `skier`
- `peacekeeper`
- `mechanic`
- `ragman`
- `jaeger`

Modded traders are supported too.

## A minimal example (recommended)
```json
{
  "id": "#trap_quest_example_1_bis#",
  "disabled": false,
  "trader_id": "mechanic",
  "name": "My first quest",
  "description": "My first quest description",
  "success_message": "My success message"
}
```

It's recommended to always use `name`, `description` and `success_message` to prevent empty messages in the game.

The `disabled` field is not mandatory but can be useful when quests are under development, it just doesn't load the concerned quest.

## Multilingual support
```json
{
  "id": "#trap_quest_example_2#",
  "trader_id": "mechanic",
  "name": {
    "en": "My second quest",
    "fr": "Ma seconde quete"
  },
  "description": {
    "en": "My quest description",
    "fr": "Ma description de quete"
  },
  "success_message": {
    "en": "My success message",
    "fr": "Mon message de succes"
  }
}
```

Some fields are translatable, these are all available locales:

- `ch`
- `cz`
- `en` (Default when not found)
- `es`
- `es-mx`
- `fr`
- `ge`
- `hu`
- `it`
- `jp`
- `kr`
- `pl`
- `po`
- `ru`
- `sk`
- `tu`

## Decoration only
```json
{
  "id": "#trap_quest_example_3#",
  "trader_id": "mechanic",
  "name": "My third quest",
  "description": "My third quest description",
  "success_message": "My success message",
  "descriptive_location": "interchange",
  "type": "Completion",
  "image": "5a29222486f77456f50d09e7"
}
```

These fiels are not mandatory and are for quest decoration only:

- `name` (empty by default)
- `description` (empty by default)
- `success_message` (empty by default)
- `descriptive_location` (`any` by default)
- `type` (`Completion` by default)
- `image` (`5a27cafa86f77424e20615d6` by default)

#### all descriptive_location
- `any` (by default)
- `customs` (or `bigmap`)
- `factory`
- `interchange`
- `labs` (or `laboratory`)
- `lighthouse`
- `reserve` (or `rezervbase`)
- `shoreline`
- `woods`

#### all type
- `Completion`
- `PickUp`
- `Elimination`
- `Loyalty`
- `Discover`

These are just for decoration purpose, please read above for more infos about Missions.

#### all images
You can found all quests images in `Aki_Data/Server/images/quests/` directory.

## Chained quests

#### Quest visibility conditions

```json
{
    "id": "#trap_quest_example_4#",
    "trader_id": "mechanic",
    "name": "My fourth quest",
    "description": "My fourth quest description",
    "success_message": "My success message",
    "level_needed": 10,
    "locked_by_quests": [
      "#trap_quest_example_1#",
      "#trap_quest_example_1_bis#"
    ],
    "unlock_on_quest_start": []
}
```

To be able to see this quest, your pmc should be at least level 10 + the `#trap_quest_example_1#` or `#trap_quest_example_1_bis#` quests should have been completed.

Also, you can use the `unlock_on_quest_start` array to specify which quests has to been started to unlock this quest.

## Rewards
This quest will give you +5000 xp, 2 ai-2 kits, 1 car first aid kit and give +0.25 loyalty to mechanic and -0.25 loyalty to prapor.

```json
{
  "id": "#trap_quest_example_5#",
  "trader_id": "mechanic",
  "name": "My rewards quest",
  "description": "Complete this quest and I will give you something",
  "success_message": "Bravo!",
  "rewards": {
    "xp": 5000,
    "items": {
      "5755356824597772cb798962": 2,
      "590c661e86f7741e566b646a": 1
    },
    "traders_reputations": {
      "mechanic": 0.25,
      "prapor": -0.25
    }
  }
}
```

- `xp`: The amount of gained xp
- `items`: The obtained items and their amount

pro-tip: You can use [this tool](https://db.sp-tarkov.com/search) to find item ids.

## Rewards on quest start
This quest give you +100 xp and 1 car first aid kit.
```json
{
  "id": "#trap_quest_example_5_start_rewards#",
  "trader_id": "mechanic",
  "name": "My rewards quest",
  "description": "Complete this quest and I will give you something",
  "success_message": "Bravo!",
  "start_rewards": {
    "xp": 5000,
    "items": {
      "5755356824597772cb798962": 2,
      "590c661e86f7741e566b646a": 1
    }
  }
}
```

## Repeatable quests
You can setup "infinite" repeatable quests like so:

```json
  {
    "id": "#trap_example_simple_repeatable_quest#",
    "repeatable": true,
    "trader_id": "fence",
    "name": {
      "en": "My first quest"
    },
    "description": {
      "en": "My description"
    },
    "success_message": {
      "en": "It works!"
    },
    "rewards": {
      "xp": 10,
      "items": {
        "5449016a4bdc2d6f028b456f": 100
      }
    }
  }
```

Limitation: you can repeat the same quest 1000 times per game, this means you have to restart the game once you repeated too much time the same quest (1000 seems enough for me but you can change this in the config)

## Missions
A quest can have several missions.

This is an example mission where you have to kill 5 scavs on customs or factory.

Completing this quest will give you 1 000 000 roubles ;-)

```json
{
  "id": "#trap_quest_example_6#",
  "trader_id": "mechanic",
  "name": "First mission",
  "description": "Kill 5 scavs on customs or factory and I will make you rich",
  "success_message": "Bravo!",
  "missions": [
    {
      "type": "Kill",
      "target": "Savage",
      "locations": [
        "customs",
        "factory"
      ],
      "count": 5,
      "message": "Kill 5 scavs on customs or factory"
    }
  ],
  "rewards": {
    "items": {
      "5449016a4bdc2d6f028b456f": 1000000
    }
  }
}
```

## Type of missions
### Kill
The player has to kill bots

A `Kill` mission payload example: 
```json
{
  "type": "Kill",
  "target": "Savage",
  "locations": [

  ],
  "count": 5,
  "message": "Kill 5 scavs on customs or factory with a 'Chiappa Rhino 50DS .357 revolver'",
  "weapons_whitelist": ["61a4c8884f95bc3b2c5dc96f"]
}
```

The `target` field:
- `Any` for any kills (default value)

The `message` is the message quest, it's available on all type of missions and support multilingual format.

The `one_session_only` means the kill counter will be reset at the end of the raid. (`false` by default)

### GiveItem
The player has to give specific item to a trader.
This mission type is compatible with [quest items](./ALL_QUEST_ITEMS.md) for `accepted_items`

A `GiveItem` mission payload example:

  "accepted_items": [
    "590c661e86f7741e566b646a"
  ],

  "message": {
    "en": "Give me 2 car first aid kits"
  }

  - You can use a [`@group`](#group-directive) id on `accepted_items` fields.

`count` is the number of item you have to provide to complete the mission (default to 1).

`found_in_raid_only` is false by default and means the item you give should be marked as FIR (found in raid).

`message` is the usual mission message.

```

Same properties as `PlaceItem` except there is no `accepted_items` field here.

Please note you can change the `type` to be `PlaceSignalJammer` instead.

### VisitPlace

`message` is the usual mission message.

`one_session_only` means the counter will be reset at the end of the raid. (`false` by default)

## Special directives
There exists special commands called `directives` in CustomQuests to help with qwuest creation.

Currently, there is 2 commands: `@group` and `@build`.

A directive is a special payload with `type` field (can only be `@group` or `@build` for now), it lives with the quests and do not need to respect any order.

### group directive
With the `@group` directive, you can define a group of items with a special id you can re-use in all `accepted_items` field as well as for `weapons_whitelist` option in [Kill](#kill) missions.

This simply the quest workflow creation when having a lot of `accepted_items`.

For example:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "@group",
    "id": "meds",
    "items": [
      "5755356824597772cb798962",
      "5b4335ba86f7744d2837a264",
      "5d1b3a5d86f774252167ba22",

        }
      }
    ]
